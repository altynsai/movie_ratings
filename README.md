# movie_ratings
NLP project on prediction of the user ratings based on the plot of the movie.
This repo consists of three files: 

- `0_data_collection`: scraping data from wikipedia

- `1_data_preprocessing_and_eda`: running preprocessing steps and trying different vectorization methods

- `2_classic_models`: trying linear regression and four classification models to identify important plot details

`data` folder consists of raw and preprocessed data used in notebooks. Large files were compressed to ZIP file. File `title.basics.tsv.gz` was too large to upload. It's updated version can be downloaded from IMBD website: https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz
